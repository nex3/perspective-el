;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides tagged workspaces in Emacs, similar to
;; workspaces in windows managers such as Awesome and XMonad (and
;; somewhat similar to multiple desktops in Gnome or Spaces in OS X).

;; perspective.el provides multiple workspaces (or "perspectives") for
;; each Emacs frame.  This makes it easy to work on many separate projects
;; without getting lost in all the buffers.

;; Each perspective is composed of a window configuration and a set of
;; buffers.  Switching to a perspective activates its window
;; configuration, and when in a perspective only its buffers are
;; available by default.

(require 'cl)

;;; Code:

;; This is only available in Emacs >23,
;; so we redefine it here for compatibility.
