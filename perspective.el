;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides tagged workspaces in Emacs, similar to
;; workspaces in windows managers such as Awesome and XMonad (and
;; somewhat similar to multiple desktops in Gnome or Spaces in OS X).

;; Perspective provides multiple workspaces (or "perspectives") for each Emacs
;; frame. This makes it easy to work on many separate projects without getting
;; lost in all the buffers.

;; Each perspective is composed of a window configuration and a set of
;; buffers.  Switching to a perspective activates its window
;; configuration, and when in a perspective only its buffers are
;; available by default.

  "This is a primitive code walker. It removes references to
potentially problematic buffers from the data structure created
by window-state-get and replaces them with references to the
perspective-specific *scratch* buffer. Buffers are considered
'problematic' when they have no underlying file, or are otherwise
transient.

The need for a recursive walk, and the consequent complexity of
this function, arises from the nature of the data structure
returned by window-state-get. That data structure is essentially
a tree represented as a Lisp list. It can contain several kinds
of nodes, including properties, nested trees representing window
splits, and windows (referred to internally as leaf nodes).

For the purposes of preserving window state, we only care about
nodes in this data structure which refer to buffers, i.e., lists
with the symbol 'buffer in the first element. These 'buffer lists
can be deeply buried inside the data structure, because it
recursively describes the layout of all windows in the given
frame. They are always nested in lists with the symbol 'leaf in
the first element.

And so, the walker descends the data structure and preserves
everything it finds. When it notices a 'leaf, it iterates over
its properties until it finds a 'buffer. If the 'buffer points to
a buffer which can be reasonably saved, it leaves it alone.
Otherwise, it replaces that buffer's node with one which points
to the perspective's *scratch* buffer."
